# Challenge 1: Refractoring-Code-Horiseon

## Description:
* Refractoring provided code for a class assignment.
* Properly create the project and deploy it to GitHub, loading live without errors.

___

## User Story:
* AS A marketing agency
* I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
* SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.

___

## Acceptance Criteria:
<u>GIVEN</u> a webpage meets accessibility standards...

* <i>WHEN</i> I view the source code,
* <b>THEN</b> I find semantic HTML elements.

* <i>WHEN</i> I view the structure of the HTML elements,
* <b>THEN</b> I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and 
positioning.
* <i>WHEN</i> I view the icon and image elements,
* <b>THEN</b> I find accessible alt attributes.
* <i>WHEN</i> I view the heading attributes,
* <b>THEN</b> they fall in sequential order.
* <i>WHEN</i> I view the title element,
* <b>THEN</b> I find a concise, descriptive title.

___

## Completed Work:
* Removed all the (div) from the HTML, replacing them with appropriate semantic and  attribute tags. (e.g., body, header, nav, h1 through h3, section, article, aside, 
footer,).
* Reorganized and consolidated the CSS code to match the updated and appropriate  semantic tags within the HTML file.
* Added alt attributes when needed.
* Removed excess CSS code.
* Added the missing link to the top right header, "Search*Engine*Optimization,"  which mirrors the other two headers to the right of it.
* Replaced the old title with a professionally appropriate one, 'Horiseon."
* Commented throughout HTML and CSS to provide the reader a more user-friendly and simple manner for following the structured code.
